## Legacy DEN

DEN is binary format for storing three dimensional arrays of either uint16, float32 or float64 values. It has fixed header with size of 6 bytes, which represent three uint16 values corresponding to array dimensions dimy, dimx, dimz in this order. Data after header are aligned in x-major order and all values are encoded little endian. DEN format or also Dennerlein format, is probably named after the German CT researcher, Dr.Ing. Frank Dennerlein. In the framework is this format used for storing volume, projection and other types of data.

The x-major alignment mean that the value representing the position (ix,iy,iz) in the volume has flat index $ ix + iy * dimx + iz * dimx * dimy$. 

### Problems with legacy format

The type of the data can only be derived from the file size and number of elements represented as given by header. Element size of uint16 is 2 bytes, float32 4 bytes and float64 8 bytes. Thus it is not possible to represent or distinguish two types with 4 bytes element size. Such element must ever be float. This is one limiting factor.

Encoding the dimension along which there is dimension-major alignment on the second position in the header is questionable. It is probably relict from encoding matrices, where we first state number of rows and then number of columns. For multidimensional arrays is this contra-intuitive. Support for y-major alignment is missing. On top of that one dimension might be at most 65535.

Fixing number of dimensions to 3 also reduces flexibility of the format. In some situations would be nice to be able to represent 1D arrays or arrays of greater dimensions than 3D.


## Extended DEN format

To address problems with legacy DEN format, KCT library implements also extended DEN, which is binary format to store multidimensional arrays of up to 16 dimensions. It follows a concept of small header followed by data entries. Extended DEN files with data are not valid legacy DEN files to be able to distinguish them by parsers. It is due to the fact, that the header of the extended file start with uint16(0). 

All the data in extended DENÂ format are in little endian order. The first 6 byte part of the header encode the data type, data type length, number of dimensions and first dimension majority. Second part of the header is then the number of uint32 corresponding to the number of dimensions that express the size along given dimension.

Subject to change :
Extended version implemented in KCT is able to represent data with each dimension up to the uint32_t_max. The header in this format is 18bytes and it starts with (0,0,0) or (0,0,1) and continues by (dimy, dimx, dimz) of uint32_t values. Format with initial part of header (0,0,0) has the same row major alignment of the remaining sequence of data, while in the format with initial part of header (0,0,1) the value representing the position (ix,iy,iz) will have a flat index $iy + ix * dimy + iz * dimx * dimy$
therefore the data are in column major order.
